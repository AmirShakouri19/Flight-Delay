# Flight-Delay
Airlines try to avoid flight delays as much as possible to avoid the associated costs related to the insurance charges and the cascading effects on their service as well as their public impression. As such, predicting flight delays can help airlines, airports, passengers and insurance companies for schadueling, decision making and allocating resources. This project aims for developing machine learning model(s) for predicting flight delays based on several pre-flight data, including: previous delays and weather.

According to the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics, the main causes of the flight delays include: National Aviation System, extreme weather condition, previous flight delays and security delays:
